# machinelearning

This is still a work in progress. 
The goal is to create a port to Python from my Octave code for the Stanford Machine Learning course: 
https://www.coursera.org/course/ml

required packages: 
- numpy
- scipy

Still to add:
- Test backpropagation (neural networks)
- Test Gradient calculation (neural networks)
- Optimization for both neural networks as logistic regression
- A one-versus-all function that makes it possible to use lr on multiple dimensions
